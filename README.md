# Different types of Similarity Searches

## 1 Cosine Similarity:

Cosine Similarity is a measure of similarity between two vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them.
It is calculated by taking the dot product of the two vectors and dividing it by the product of their magnitudes.
Cosine Similarity ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect similarity, -1 indicates perfect dissimilarity, and 0 indicates orthogonality (the vectors are perpendicular to each other).
It is commonly used in text mining, document analysis, and recommendation systems.

## 2 Euclidean Distance:

Euclidean Distance is the straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space.
In a two-dimensional space, it is the length of the line segment connecting two points.
In n-dimensional space, it is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences between corresponding coordinates of the two points.
Euclidean Distance measures the "as-the-crow-flies" distance between two points.
It is used in various applications such as clustering, classification, and regression algorithms.

## 3 Manhattan Distance (also known as Taxicab or City Block Distance):

Manhattan Distance is the sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates between two points in a grid system.
Unlike Euclidean Distance, it measures the distance traveled along the grid lines, resembling the path a taxicab would take between two points in a city (hence the name).
In a two-dimensional space, it is the distance between two points measured along axes at right angles.
In n-dimensional space, it is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding coordinates of the two points.
Manhattan Distance is often preferred in situations where movement can only occur along orthogonal (right angle) paths, such as in city grids or certain types of feature spaces in machine learning.
